## 👋 Hi, I’m Luca — Software Developer & Founder

I’m a software developer focused on building **practical, scalable digital solutions** — from modern web applications to enterprise-grade SharePoint & Microsoft Teams integrations.

My core expertise lies in **front-end development** with React and TypeScript, combined with solid full-stack experience and a strong focus on real-world usability, maintainability, and performance.

## 💼 Professional Experience

After completing an intensive bootcamp at **Constructor Academy (Zurich)**, I started working as a **Frontend Developer** in early 2024, specializing in:

- SharePoint Framework (SPFx) WebParts  
- Microsoft Teams integrations  
- Custom React-based business applications  

Since then, I’ve:
- built multiple **custom WebParts** from scratch  
- implemented **feature enhancements and change requests**  
- debugged and stabilized existing enterprise solutions  
- worked closely with real users, requirements, and production systems  

This experience shaped my approach to building **robust, maintainable software in real-world environments**.
