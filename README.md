## 👋 Hi, I’m Luca — Software Developer

I’m a software developer focused on building **practical, scalable digital solutions** — from modern web applications to enterprise-grade SharePoint and Microsoft Teams integrations.

> ⚠️ Most of my daily development work happens in private enterprise repositories on Azure DevOps.  
> That means many of my commits, pull requests, and code reviews are not visible on my public GitHub profile.

My core expertise lies in **front-end development with React and TypeScript**, combined with solid full-stack experience and a strong focus on usability, maintainability, and performance in real production environments.

## 💼 Professional Experience

After completing an intensive bootcamp at Constructor Academy (Zurich), I started working as a Frontend Developer in early 2024, specializing in:

- SharePoint Framework (SPFx) WebParts  
- Microsoft Teams integrations  
- Custom React-based business applications  

Since then, I’ve:
- built multiple **custom WebParts** from scratch  
- implemented **feature enhancements and change requests**  
- debugged and stabilized existing enterprise solutions  
- worked closely with real users, requirements, and live production systems  

This experience shaped my approach to building **robust, maintainable software that performs reliably in real-world enterprise environments**.
